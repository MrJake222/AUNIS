1. You are ***allowed*** to:
	* Look around the code and figure out what I did (feel free to ask about certain solutions, on [*Discord*](https://discord.gg/UzuhJQ4) for example).
	*  Clone the repo and build it for your private use (or sharing with a limited number of people. ***No reuploads.***).
	*  Clone and make pull requests.


2. You're ***not allowed*** to:
	* Copy-paste the code into your own project. One function or helper class is good, copying whole functionality (Like [**RaumShips**](https://github.com/MatWein/RaumShips) owner did, copied whole Rings) is not.
	* Redistribute binaries/source code on some third-party pages(Just link to the Curse/GitHub).


3. All licenses of works listed in README should be abided.
